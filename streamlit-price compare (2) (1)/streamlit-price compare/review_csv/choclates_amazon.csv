Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Pocky Biscuit Stick 1.41oz (Pack of 4) (Chocolate),Not boxed,3.0,"I was dissapointed when we received the order because the photos showed individual boxes of the Pocky Sticks. We ordered Cookies and Cream and Strawberry. The Strawberry arrived in the boxes, the Cookies and Cream arrived in individual white packages, no boxes. We were planning to use these as part of a party favor and ordered the box version on purpose. It would be nice if the photos matched what you were receiving."
