"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Mini Projector,Hasatek Projector with WiFi and Bluetooth，Projector 4K Support，Portable Projector for Home Theater Outdoor Movie Projector with HDMI USB Interfaces for TV Stick, iOS, Android，PC，Tablet",Just so so projector,3.0,"I only use this ptojector to mirroring screen from my smartphone, it works if both are using the same wifi. But the sound, screen quality doesn't worth a $200 projector. Screen is not clear enough, I always want to adjust the focus to make it more clear but failed, so cannot watch it for too long make me feel dizzy. Also the youtube chanel in it just like a joke, only some build in trailers, cannot search or connect to my account. This one is only for fun, you can use it for short time video not TV or movie."
"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Mini Projector,Hasatek Projector with WiFi and Bluetooth，Projector 4K Support，Portable Projector for Home Theater Outdoor Movie Projector with HDMI USB Interfaces for TV Stick, iOS, Android，PC，Tablet",Works great,5.0,"This is a great projector. It has great picture and sound.The projector is easy to set up and connect. I was impressed how easy it was. I got this for when it warms up and when a group of us go camping. It will be nice to just sit around, have a few drinks and Netflix and Chill :)  This is also great to set up indoor tents for the kids and have a little movie night."
"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Mini Projector,Hasatek Projector with WiFi and Bluetooth，Projector 4K Support，Portable Projector for Home Theater Outdoor Movie Projector with HDMI USB Interfaces for TV Stick, iOS, Android，PC，Tablet",Mini Projector,2.0,I really wanted to like this projector and when I ordered it there were no reviews so I took a chance on it.  I was disappointed in this projector and after reading some of the other reviews I can say I had all the problems that everyone else had with it.  First it is not hard to hook to internet so I thought we were off to a good start but that was the extent of the easy tasks on this unit.  I did finally get it to project with my Chromecast attached to it.  Many other reviews said that Apple Airplay only plays sound with no picture and this was my experience too.  I never got my android phone to hook via the Mircast app because they want a credit card on file to use that app and I just was not willing to do that so I can't speak to whether this part worked or not.  The YouTube portion is not good and only plays preloaded trailers.  It did not come with extra cords so I could try to hook directly and use it that way.  If you could find the correct cords to hook your phone directly to it that might make the difference but that was an added cost I didn't pursue and I am not sure I would even know what to buy to get it to work.  The picture quality was ok when I used the Chromecast and the sound was ok as well.  It just didn't wow me like I was hoping and to use it was very cumbersome and awkward.  I gave just 2 stars and I do feel this is probably being generous because I did finally get to see a picture with the added Chromecast.  There are better projector options out there.  This one just missed the mark and for this reason I cannot recommend it.

It took me just a moment to set everything up. The quality is very nice. If you find a good dark spot for it, you will not want to use the TV anymore. Perfect for movie nights or video games. It is not too big so that makes easy to find a place to place it. Not heavy at all. I recommend it for family and friends moments."
"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Mini Projector,Hasatek Projector with WiFi and Bluetooth，Projector 4K Support，Portable Projector for Home Theater Outdoor Movie Projector with HDMI USB Interfaces for TV Stick, iOS, Android，PC，Tablet",Great picture,5.0,"I had no trouble hooking the HDMI cable to my computer to play movies, the sound was good coming from the projector.  I have not been able to connect to my Wi-Fi.  I am not very Tech savvy so I will definitely need help doing that.  I watched on a blank wall, I plan on getting a projection screen.  I wish there was a way to make it taller, setting on a tabletop really isn’t high enough to view well.  I set it on several books to raise it up.  It does get hot, so be careful moving it around.  Overall it is a great projector, just wish I knew more about technology so I could use all the features.  I am sure with time I will get much better at using it."

My intention was silely for airplay streaming to reduce cables, other devices, cable box, etcUnfortunately,:1) when i use airplay, it only plays audio, and the screen says “airplay, music…” - absolutely no video at all.2) the youtube app keeps on saying server error.

For example there’s a “house” button which you would think will bring you to the main menu or home. It doesn’t. It just brings up a screen with options to select inputs/sources. There’s an on-screen button to turn on/off airplay but underneath it there’s also a back button. Both pretty much does the same thing.For $200, do not buy this mini projector.

Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Supersonic SC-1311 13.3&#34; Widescreen LED HDTV,Smaller than I pictured..,3.0,The screen is smaller than I pictured.  It is for use in a kitchen.  Was unable to pair it with my Xfinity remote even though a code appeared for this brand - it would not work - not would any of the others I found searching the internet.  Picture is pretty good for the size and cost.  Sound is a little tinney but that is not surprising considering the size of the TV and speakers.
Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Supersonic SC-1311 13.3&#34; Widescreen LED HDTV,Works for my needs on small setup,4.0,I needed a small TV for the office and something that worked in the RV on the road in a bunk. This fit the build. I was replacing an older one that the backlight was starting to get flaky on. This is 12v and 110. The 110v cord is attach and is not removable. The 12v cord from the old unit worked to power in my RV. The sound is nothing spectacular but it is loud enough to hear over the AC or furnace in the trailer. It sounds a bit tinny but suits it purpose just fine in both the office and RV. I wish the AC cord was removable but i just tie it up when using in the RV as I prefer 12v power so I dont have to plug in house power or run an inverter.

Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Supersonic SC-1311 13.3&#34; Widescreen LED HDTV,not bad for the money,4.0,"Picture is great...voice sound is very ""tinny"".... I have Spectrum as a cable provider, and I tried all the Supersonic codes, but could not get the remote to tie into the tv. So the end result is just that you would either use the tv remote to turn off the tv or push the power button on the top of the screen. I use this tv in my home office next to my computer, so I simply push the power button on top of the tv. You will need the tv remote to adjust the sound too.....for everything else the Spectrum remote works just fine."
Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Supersonic SC-1311 13.3&#34; Widescreen LED HDTV,Not as pictured and does not support universal remotes,3.0,"The image shows speakers facing forward below the screen. The TV that I received had the speakers facing down, so they are not visible from the front. The TV otherwise is fully functional with all the connection options I would expect on a small TV. I was disappointed that I could not use my Xfinitiy/Comcast remote with it. I called Supersonic and, without asking the model, they informed me that they did not have a code for use with Xfinity and did not support ""universal"" remotes. I give them some credit for answering the phone. I then spent about an hour on the phone with Xfinity and they were unable to get it to work. I have never run into this before and it seems like a big miss to me. It just means that you have to have both remotes handy or else use the buttons on the TV to power on and modify the volume."
Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Supersonic SC-1311 13.3&#34; Widescreen LED HDTV,May be difficult to install; no support,2.0,"Be aware this seller provides no support at all.  I found the instruction manual inadequate, and I nearly returned the unit due to installation difficulties.  The product evidently is designed to rely on an HDMI-compatible input source.  However, no HDMI cable is provided. So, if you are replacing a unit that did not have HDMI input, you will not be able to install this product out of the box.  You will need to buy a cable.  Also, all of the input ports are recessed onto the back panel in such a way that the cables  must enter at a difficult angle.  A VGA cable I had on hand would not fit at all. I also tried RCA cables, and they fit, but I could not get them to work. The lack of clear instructions may have been a contributing factor.  After I obtained an HDMI cable, I was able to connect it with some difficulty. The unit functions now, but I would not recommend it. The picture is much smaller than the screen. It looks odd, but I cannot find a way to adjust it.  The screen is small to begin with, so the smaller picture looks tiny."

Worked perfectly, so I bought a big screen and a tri-pod stand for it.  Works with my google Chromecast, and my Nintendo Switch.  We set it up in the living room at night.  Or just hang up some blackout curtains and use it during the day.  Speaker is loud enough for small space indoors, but when we're outdoors we plug a speaker into it."

The brightness and clarity which are provided is probably some of the best which I have seen thus far and it comes at an extremely reasonable price point. I cannot say enough about how easy it is to get up-and-rolling, whether it is connecting to a laptop, a phone, or even an external device such as a Roku or Firestick. There is a pretty decent speaker internally, but I opt to connect a small sound bar of mine to the headphone jack instead. That is just my personal preference though! You cannot go wrong with the remote either, that is like the icing on the cake: not necessary, but so good! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to take their family's/friend's entertainment outdoors. We use a rather large projection screen at 8' wide by roughly 5' high and the projector is back from there around 9'-10'... and this thing puts out HD quality, hands down! We have only watched some movies/shows for my 5-year old and a little baseball, but I cannot WAIT to put some MMA up on there soon!!!"

For the price, I expected much less.  I have an epson in the livingroom that cost 10x what this did, so I was concerned that, having been spoiled by the one in the living room, I would be unhappy with this one.  During unboxing I began to worry I would have to send it back, the look and feel is very light and plasticy.  So, why the 5 stars?  I mounted this little beaty to the headboard of my bed, pointed at the ceiling, plugged in a roku, and away went!  The image is very good, and frame rate is smooth.  Also, to my surprise, its quite bright, and has good contrast.  (My first projector was a Sharp Dt-510, anything darker than brown was just lost as black) .  This little Iolieo is not just visible with the lights one, but actually looks pretty good.  And, if I turn off the lights, it of course gets much better.  In summary, its a great little projector, to my surprise.  Getch ya one!"

I’m very impressed by the size and portability. It is so easy to carry around and take around. I like the ability of the stand to carry it off the ground and angle the image onto the wall. It comes with all the cords required as well as a nice remote control. The brightness is amazing for something so small. My only issue is I wish for a little better picture quality and and ease in adjusting the quality. I wasn’t quite able to get the video image to look “perfect” but it was still good enough to display a video. I liked the sound quality from the projector and produces good ability to be used as speakers.

 Theaters are back open where I live, but I still don't feel safe/comfortable to go there due to the pandemic, so I decided to give this projector a shot. I'm glad I did. It's got a nice design and looks good. Feels quality in hands. It's got a height adjusting screw as well as an extension screw if you want to set it up even higher. I like how it supports a thumb drive input, which makes it easier to bring my movies and this projector to my friend's house. The picture quality is good too. I uploaded a video to show it. I'm not sure if it's clear, but I was adjusting focus and screen tilt in the beginning. My phone's camera kept refocusing because my hand wasn't steady, so it the video may look blurry momentarily. That's just my phone, not the projector. I'm happy with it overall."

I have mine set up 8 feet away and sit directly under the projector. I'm shooting the projector onto a textured wall. I have around a 90 inch screen on my wall.The only real issues for me is the projector gives off a bit of heat in my small office as all projectors do.  Other than that I can read text fine and am typing this review on my projected wall. After two days I can say for certain I have significantly relieved my eyes strain. I still have my regular monitors nearby for things that are really detailed but  I try to avoid using them.400 hours updateAfter using mine for around 400 hours I have an issue where lines appear on the screen when I have been running the projector for a few hours. See second pic. I would still recommend this projector though.

First off at this price you can't go wrong. 5500 lumen, powerful sound in the projector and has HDMI connector. I connected my firestick to it and it came out clear. I still need to buy a stand a projector screen but when I shined it against my wall the picture looked clear as any other TV. It is a projector so you already know that you can't view images in daylight but in poorly lit rooms it will shine pretty clear.I tested it against my wall (yellow painted) and the ceiling. One in complete darkness and the other in a lit room. You can see the results.It was easy to set up. Just plugged in the power cord, connected my firestick to run netflix and that was it. Easy peazy."

 I wasn’t expecting much, even though it’s 720 p it’s good quality, it’s better if you have an actual projection screen but I’m just using a sheet lol. I thought it would be loud but it’s not bad you can definitely hear the fan but the sound quality over takes that. And you can adjust the screen size projection which I was worried about cause I have it fixed above my bed and the curtain is hanging from the foot of my bed. I am pleasantly surprised it’s not as cheap as I thought it would be. 10/10"

Unfortunately, I was unable to try it out because the only power supply cord it came with was a Type G (240v) - which is not compatible with our American Type A (120v) outlets."

I have had no problems with it until I traveled out side of the states. It is supposed to be able to hold two different sim cards in the sim holder. I would only hold one. I don't know if that is an upgrade or not. Since it it dual sim capable it should be able to hold both sim cards and not be an upgrade. For as much money as you have to pay for the phone.

I came to this from a Note 9. Wasn't sure about the switch but they discontinued the Note series. I got the ultra because it seemed most comparable and had the S pen.
