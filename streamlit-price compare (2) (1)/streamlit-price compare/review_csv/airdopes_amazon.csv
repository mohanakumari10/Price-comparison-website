Wired Earbuds","Quality, Iconic Apple EarPods",5.0,"These are definitely original Apple EarPods, and they work well. I have ordered them multiple times over the past five years and each time they are new, in box, and working. As a $16-$30 product, they won't last forever, and aren't as good as $100 pair of headphones. But for your every day use at the computer and on the go these iconic EarPods are the way to go!"
"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Apple EarPods Headphones with 3.5mm Plug. Microphone with Built-in Remote to Control Music, Phone Calls, and Volume. Wired Earbuds",Very Nice,5.0,Review time! Today is my first time using these earphones after the mic on my AirPods went out and needed some corded ones to use with my MacBook Pro. According to others that I have face-timed with while using these earphones they can hear me very well. Also the sound quality of receiving audio is also efficient. I can hear audio clearly out of both earphones which is important to me as I have meetings and spend a lot of time on my computer. I definitely recommend these earphones if you need something reliable just in case there may be some technical difficulties with bluetooth sets.

Wired Earbuds",Classic go to,5.0,"Apple ear pod headphones are the best. I've been using them for the past 10-15 years and the design is the same so I am happy whenever I have to replace them. They fit in my ears perfectly. Times when I tried the cheaper brands, they either hurt my ears or never lasted long. The last pair I had lasted me 6 years. This pair I bought them for my new job to plug into my computer and I use them every day. I don't have to worry about charging since they are plugged in."

Wired Earbuds",Great for professional job interviews/settings,4.0,"As a gamer, I usually prefer bulky gaming headphones, but I needed something low profile for job interviews. These earbuds are perfect for that purpose.The sound quality is impressive, and the microphone with the built-in remote is a convenient feature that allows me to control my music, phone calls, and volume with ease. I appreciate that the design of the EarPods is unique and fits well in my ears, which is a common issue I have with other earbuds.The only downside is that the cables can get tangled easily, but if you have a 3D printer, I recommend printing a small case for them. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, and I recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for a cheap, low profile headphone option."

"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Apple EarPods Headphones with 3.5mm Plug. Microphone with Built-in Remote to Control Music, Phone Calls, and Volume. Wired Earbuds",The only review you need. READ FOR DETAILS ABOUT EVERYTHING,5.0,"If you are too lazy to read my essay then I will give a quick rundown:REAL Product - They are real apple earbuds, durable and people are lyingFit / Comfort - They will fit small ears amazingly and feel like nothing is there, big ears not so muchSound - Low end and mid is great. Nothing special, high end slightly lacking but its barely noticableDurability - Lasted me for 1.5 years so far, tough and will survive water (swimming, washing machine)Damage - None. They were perfect and still are right out the boxMic - Dont get for a mic. Its in the speakers themselves and are too quiet, but they are in 2 channels igTangling - They do get tangled but they are easy to untangleOverall - 9.5/10, get if you have small or average ears, they feel like nothing is in your earFULL DETAILED REVIEW:Im writing this to discourage the negative reviews that I see way too much about these things. They are REAL apple made products. They did not come used, broken, or anything. I bought these as I wanted some actual good earbuds that would last. I have used the samsung ones for about 2 years when I broke them, so I tried apple. I found some laying around in school (ik its gross) washed em, and they worked great. Sound quality is actually very good for earbuds, however I havent used any super expensive headphones that would blow me away and make these sound terrible in comparison. The low end or ""bass"" is very important to me and thankfully it is pretty loud, nothing outstanding or anything though. The High end is kindof lacking but not much, still sounds great. Mid sound is loudest, not overwhelming though, pretty good. Anyway, I lost those, so I ordered them, on Amazon. They came early, unused, undamaged, and they sound great. No complaints and they have lasted me for nearly a year. Now an issue you might have with these buds if at all are 2 things: Fit and Comfort. These will not fit everybody's ears, escpecially big ones. However, they fit in mine perfectly and within a minute I forget I even have anything in my ear, but thats just me. 2 is comfort, which some people have issues with. I think these are incredibly comfortable with the non-silicon tips. They dont hurt, but maybe thats just me. I hate the silicon tips, but some people dont. Either way, you can get used to them. Other things to mention; you can drown these in water or leave them in the wash accidentally and they will work fine. As long as their not in deep water for like over an hour, they should still work. also, Tangling is not a big problem with these. They definetly do get tangled, but they are very easy to ungtangle unlike other buds. Lastly, Microphone. I would not recomment these if you need them to have a good mic. I was surprised to test these and find out the Volume controller that has a mic label on it isnt actually a mic, the phones themselves are. And they are weird. They are wayyyyy too quiet and each but has its own channel, so you can talk into say the left bud and whoever is recieving your mic signal will hear only out the left headphone. You also have to have it so close to your mouth that you are pretty much making out with it. Besides that, they are amazing. Some people with love them, others will hate. If you have small ears, I recomment these. They come in a nice little box too. They will feel like nothing is there. 9.5/10 earbuds in my opinion. Best earbuds I have ever used. GET THEM"

"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Apple EarPods Headphones with 3.5mm Plug. Microphone with Built-in Remote to Control Music, Phone Calls, and Volume. Wired Earbuds",Great for professional job interviews/settings,4.0,"As a gamer, I usually prefer bulky gaming headphones, but I needed something low profile for job interviews. These earbuds are perfect for that purpose.The sound quality is impressive, and the microphone with the built-in remote is a convenient feature that allows me to control my music, phone calls, and volume with ease. I appreciate that the design of the EarPods is unique and fits well in my ears, which is a common issue I have with other earbuds.The only downside is that the cables can get tangled easily, but if you have a 3D printer, I recommend printing a small case for them. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, and I recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for a cheap, low profile headphone option."

Wired Earbuds",Great for people that still like corded ear buds,5.0,"I bought these for my son who likes ear buds with a cord. He prefers the Apple ear design. These have been perfect. No issues or malfunctioning. Sound quality is good, but is not noise cancelling. Not sure why they are advertised this way."

"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Apple EarPods Headphones with 3.5mm Plug. Microphone with Built-in Remote to Control Music, Phone Calls, and Volume. Wired Earbuds",The only review you need. READ FOR DETAILS ABOUT EVERYTHING,5.0,"If you are too lazy to read my essay then I will give a quick rundown:REAL Product - They are real apple earbuds, durable and people are lyingFit / Comfort - They will fit small ears amazingly and feel like nothing is there, big ears not so muchSound - Low end and mid is great. Nothing special, high end slightly lacking but its barely noticableDurability - Lasted me for 1.5 years so far, tough and will survive water (swimming, washing machine)Damage - None. They were perfect and still are right out the boxMic - Dont get for a mic. Its in the speakers themselves and are too quiet, but they are in 2 channels igTangling - They do get tangled but they are easy to untangleOverall - 9.5/10, get if you have small or average ears, they feel like nothing is in your earFULL DETAILED REVIEW:Im writing this to discourage the negative reviews that I see way too much about these things. They are REAL apple made products. They did not come used, broken, or anything. I bought these as I wanted some actual good earbuds that would last. I have used the samsung ones for about 2 years when I broke them, so I tried apple. I found some laying around in school (ik its gross) washed em, and they worked great. Sound quality is actually very good for earbuds, however I havent used any super expensive headphones that would blow me away and make these sound terrible in comparison. The low end or ""bass"" is very important to me and thankfully it is pretty loud, nothing outstanding or anything though. The High end is kindof lacking but not much, still sounds great. Mid sound is loudest, not overwhelming though, pretty good. Anyway, I lost those, so I ordered them, on Amazon. They came early, unused, undamaged, and they sound great. No complaints and they have lasted me for nearly a year. Now an issue you might have with these buds if at all are 2 things: Fit and Comfort. These will not fit everybody's ears, escpecially big ones. However, they fit in mine perfectly and within a minute I forget I even have anything in my ear, but thats just me. 2 is comfort, which some people have issues with. I think these are incredibly comfortable with the non-silicon tips. They dont hurt, but maybe thats just me. I hate the silicon tips, but some people dont. Either way, you can get used to them. Other things to mention; you can drown these in water or leave them in the wash accidentally and they will work fine. As long as their not in deep water for like over an hour, they should still work. also, Tangling is not a big problem with these. They definetly do get tangled, but they are very easy to ungtangle unlike other buds. Lastly, Microphone. I would not recomment these if you need them to have a good mic. I was surprised to test these and find out the Volume controller that has a mic label on it isnt actually a mic, the phones themselves are. And they are weird. They are wayyyyy too quiet and each but has its own channel, so you can talk into say the left bud and whoever is recieving your mic signal will hear only out the left headphone. You also have to have it so close to your mouth that you are pretty much making out with it. Besides that, they are amazing. Some people with love them, others will hate. If you have small ears, I recomment these. They come in a nice little box too. They will feel like nothing is there. 9.5/10 earbuds in my opinion. Best earbuds I have ever used. GET THEM"

Â Some of these little earbuds PAUSE and cut out when one bud or the other is taken out of commission, put in the charger, etc.  This set PLAYS ON, which, as my daughter informs me is a real coup and a GREAT FEATURE!Come to think of it, even mine do that.  If one dies, then the song or program I'm listening to is INTERRUPTED until I either press PLAY again.  I know what she means.And, these have AMAZINGLY GOOD SOUND for their price point.  STRONG rockin' bass, full midrange and highs.... what's not to love!?All Good!  : - )"

Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth Headphones IPX7 Waterproof Bluetooth Earbuds 30H Playtime Headset with Charging Case Wireless Bluetooth Earphones with Mic for iPhone/Samsung/Android (White),U need this!,5.0,"I have had this item for about a wk. I wanted to get really use to it and see if it was gnna be something a really reach for, and I love it. It charges super quick. There is 3 settings that are 3 OBVIOUS different speeds. I tried to stand it up and have it just blow my face but it kept losing its balance because of the speed, but I stuck it inside the roll of a new paper roll and guess what it's the perfect hack lol I use it for when I wash my face so I'm not using a harsh towel or a towel that possibly harbors some type of bacteria... I use it for skin care, serums, masks, toners, everything it's also soo refreshing while it dries my face... I use it for make up and to dry my setting spray.. it's just a very cute and sturdy product. I'm glad I got a couple extra cause they are good for gifts as well."
