"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Dynasty, Season 5",No male survivors...,5.0,"The ""camp, fun, cheesy"" line of analysis misses the point by a mile. Dynasty is ten years of men getting the crap kicked out of them by the women in their lives.  The men are dominated, fooled, cheated on, lied to, manipulated and exploited out of anything like stable rewarding lives by an endless succession of hotties cashing in on their absolutely nuclear irresistability  .  Supposed paragon of virtue Krystle throws Blake curves, in every sense, while pulling the rug out from under him with a succession of men from her past that she has to appease at Blake's expense.It's a shark tank feeding frenzy of couture and jewels among the most georgeous female cast ever assembled within a single screen project of any kind.

"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Dynasty, Season 5",The 'Ultimate' Season of Dynasty,5.0,"It seems strange to me that Season 6 has received so few reviews on here- Season 6 was an ultimate chapter in the overall success of Dynasty. It maintained the Number One spot as the most popular show in the US (along with dozens of other countries) for all 29 episodes in 1985, and every hour is an extravagant and flamboyant example of why the show was constantly over it's budget of one million dollars per episode!  It's ALL here...The glitz, the glamour, the outrageous greed, the appalling power plays, the romance, the intrigue, the betrayal, and all the life and death drama that weaves the twisted and tangled textile where some make 'Love', some make 'War', and the BEST of them make BOTH at exactly the same time. 'Go To Bed' with Dynasty Season 6 and TAKE what the Good Life has to offer!"

"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Dynasty, Season 5",A banner season,4.0,"My favorite TV vice from the 80's...probably because it's so preposterous. This was a banner season for the wild and crazy plots, starting with Fallon's supposed 'death,' the emerging character of Diahann Carroll's Dominique, meeting Blake's father, Tom, the birth of Krystina, the introduction of Amanda (Catherine Oxenberg), the controversial kiss between HIV-stricken Rock Hudson as Daniel Reece and Linda Evans' Krystle, and of course, the dominating presence of Joan Collins as Alexis.  The season ends with a new Fallon (Emma Samms), the lead-in to Krystle's imposter, Rita; and the ridiculous Moldavian wedding shooting. Ali McGraw also guest stars as Lady Ashley Mitchell."
"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Dynasty, Season 5",WOW! I Can't Wait To See Season 6 and The Colbys!,5.0,"INCREDIBLE SEASON! I've read this was the top rated season out of all 9! It's VERY GOOD and the season finale is the best yet! A LOT of very famous guest faces too! Season 6 is when The Colbys come into the show and the other show ""The Colbys"" started for 2 seasons. I already bought that to watch as it aired. The only thing here on Amazon is Episode 27 or 28 the sound is out of sync so it looks like a dubbed foreign film. You'll be so into the story line you won't care for one episode. A MUST SEE!"

"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Dynasty, Season 5",FINALLY SEASON 5,5.0,It is good to finally see Season 5 available! Many viewers feel that this is the season that Dynasty began to slip with high paid celebrities coming aboard and the Royal Wedding Massacre being the straws that broke the Carrington's back. But true Dynasty fans simply refer to it as Classic Dynasty.So pull up a comfy chair and open your favorite can of caviar and indulge in this guilty pleasure once again!!I personally like this season because it brought back both Sammy Jo and Fallon and made them permanent staples in the Carrington household once again.

Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Wireless Earbuds 4 Mic Clear Call Bluetooth Headphones with Wireless Charging Case 60H PlayBack Over Ear Earphones Bass Stereo in Ear Buds LED Display Waterproof Earhooks for Sport Running Workout Gym,Wireless Earbuds 4 Mic Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones w/ 60H Wireless Charging Case,5.0,"Only just started using them, but the sound is extremely good for the price. Got them on sale for $25.49. I've DJ'd for 20 years of my life and would equate the sounds stage to some of the better professional over-the-ear headsets I've used over the years. I've not used the mic yet, but great earbuds sound-wise so far!Update: The microphone(s) are pretty bad, unfortunately. I bought 4 different brands of Chinese earbuds and I figured with this one advertising 4 mics, it would be the best of the bunch for calling. It's actually the worst of the 4, and by a long shot. People on the line cannot hear me at max volume unless I'm shouting regardless of how loud or quiet my environment is.I will likely keep these earbuds just for listening to music because the sound stage is great, but I wouldn't recommend them if you're looking for earbuds primarily for calls."
Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Wireless Earbuds 4 Mic Clear Call Bluetooth Headphones with Wireless Charging Case 60H PlayBack Over Ear Earphones Bass Stereo in Ear Buds LED Display Waterproof Earhooks for Sport Running Workout Gym,Good headphones so far,5.0,"I‚Äôve had these for about a month and so far so good. I‚Äôve had numerous bad experiences with other Bluetooth headphones. I have worn these while working out and sweating for up to two hours and they still work well. I dry them off before putting them back in the case. The battery holds a really long time. I also wore them on an airplane for 5 hours and my ears started to get a little sore by the end, but overall they were good and didn‚Äôt die. I can‚Äôt speak to the sound quality - I don‚Äôt really care that much as long as they work. You should note that they offer rewards for reviews, however, I do give this an honest 5 star review for now, and will update it if these end up being unsatisfactory."
Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Wireless Earbuds 4 Mic Clear Call Bluetooth Headphones with Wireless Charging Case 60H PlayBack Over Ear Earphones Bass Stereo in Ear Buds LED Display Waterproof Earhooks for Sport Running Workout Gym,Great but...,4.0,"These fit wonderful, the sound quality is great,  compact, love the charging station and the features of these earbuds but there are two problems I experienced.  If your earbuds are connected to another device like your iPad and you want to connect them to another such as your phone you have to disconnect them from the device you originally connected them to before connecting.  This took me a day to figure out the problem and finally checking all my devices to see what device they were connected to.  Previous brands or earbuds did not have this issue.  Also, my husband bought a pair because I liked these so much and he had to send them back because they are named the same and kept mixing up on our devices and we could not find a way to name them differently or not have the mix up occur."
